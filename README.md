# Playlist Builder App

This app allows users to build a playlist from an existing library of songs, or addd their own songs using an 'Add Song' form. This form takes a song title, artist, and album image to generate a new song card to append to the library and/or playlist.

The user is also able to delete songs from the library and/or playlist.

## Technologies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The app utilizes JavaScript, React.js, JSX, HTML, and CSS. Styled-components was used for styling within components.

## Installation

To run the app locally, clone the code into your machine with 'git clone'.

To install packages, run 'npm install'.

Running 'npm run server' runs the server at [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003).

Running 'npm start' runs the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Future Direction

To improve this project in the future, a sort/filter function or search bar could be added in the music library. Styling-wise, functionality could be implemented to toggle visual appearance of the playlist, making it more customizable.
